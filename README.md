# nvim-python-repl 

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/460861.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/460861)

A simple plugin that leverages treesitter to send expressions, statements,
function definitions and class definitions to a REPL. 

The plugin now supports three different filetypes: python, scala and lua. It is
suggested that you have [ipython](https://ipython.org/),
[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org), and [ilua](https://github.com/guysv/ilua)
installed in your path respectively. (Scala projects are expecting that the scala file
is opened from the directory containing `build.sbt`).

In addition to sending treesitter objects, there is also support for sending a
selection from visual mode. 

### Usage 

Can be installed with any plugin manager. For example, in packer you can use 

``` use "geg2102/nvim-python-repl" ```

Somewhere in your init.lua/init.vim you should place 

``` require("nvim-python-repl").setup() ```

### Keymaps

There are no keymaps by default. As an example, one could create a keymap in normal mode
on `<leader>n` that executes `SendPyObject` to send a treesitter object.
The command will send the smallest semantic unit at the cursor. If the
cursor is somewhere within an expression, the expression will be sent, even if the
expression is within a function. If the cursor is on the function definition, the entire
function will be sent. If it is on a class definition, the entire class will be sent. 

With a similar keymap in visual mode, `<leader>n` sends visual selection to repl.

A keymapping for sending the entire buffer could be `<leader>nr`.

```
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', [your keymap], ":SendPyObject<CR>", {noremap=true, silent=true}) 
``` 

``` 
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('v', [your keymap], ":<C-U>SendPySelection<CR>",{noremap=true, silent=true}) 
```

``` 
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', [your keymap], ":SendPyBuffer<CR>", {noremap=true,silent=true}) 
```

```
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', [your keymap], ":ToggleExecuteOnSend<CR>", {noremap=true,silent=true})
```

### Options 
There are a few options. First, whether to execute the given expression on send
and second, whether to send to a vertical split. By default these are set to true. Toggle on send
can be toggled with `<leader>e` or `:ToggleExecuteOnSend`. Whether to send to vertical
by default can be changed with `:ReplToggleVertical` or `:lua
require("nvim-python-repl").toggle_vertical()`. 


There is an also an option to specify which spawn command you want to use for a given repl (passed as table). 

Here is the default setup: 

``` 
require("nvim-python-repl").setup({
    execute_on_send=false, 
    vsplit=false,
    spawn_command={
        python="ipython", 
        scala="sbt console",
        lua="ilua"
    }
}) 
```
